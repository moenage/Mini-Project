# Mini-Project

Socket Programming Project. 
A web server will handle one HTTP request at a time, and implements the following messages for all of the relevant methods to the client: 
200	OK
304	Not Modified
400	Bad request
404	Not Found
408	Request Timed Out

To test your web server, copy test.html Download test.htmlin the same directory of your web server. Then find out the IP address of your machine, and port used in the code for web server.

Then implemented a web proxy server with testing implemented for it.
